I spent some of my years in the Netherlands and I learnt this expression
in a very peculiar way... it stayed in my head and it would come every now and then,
just because sometimes I go to some shops, look around and then boom, go back without
a single transaction on my bank account, and my hands empty. 


Now the funny thing is that a couple of weeks back I was in Germany, 
starting a new job and my it happened that my
favourite bag pack have had half broken, so I thought oh well I would go and check
if I see something around. So I started walking around and going into some bag packs
shops in the city, I would stay there for a few minutes and then come out with
hands empty as usual, nothing was really worth. At the end of the day, I got a reminder
from my phone saying: 'Google Maps has been using your location...' and I didn't pay much attention.
But then the next following days, I started seeing lots of ads in my social media
with billboards saying: we know you didn't buy your bagpack, we tracked you, we know
your bank card transactions, you didn't buy them, but you looked a lot. Here,
buy them online, we know you want a new bagpack!. 
This is interesting, I starting thinking how can Google Maps or any location service
track what you are doing, what shops you visit, how long you stay there, if you bought
something or not, if you would want to buy it, even if you were with someone.
That's how I decided to share these thoughts here and from an engineering point of view
I think this is gold and I know Google is already doing this, all major tech companies
are doing it...

Hi Google Maps team,

I only have a questions that has been on my mind for several weeks already. 
I know that Google is quite accurate to recommend stuff you would like to buy 
(or search or anything) via the ads, the way the algorithm works on your side and obviously 
the huge amount of data you collect on a user's basis. 

Some time ago I broke my bag pack but as it was my favourite one, 
I didn't want to replace it, but anyways I would still walk around the Bag Pack shops 
every now and then, look for the prices, models, etc. 
but never actually bought one. A few days after that, 
I started receiving ads about bag packs on pretty much all my social media, 
specially the non-google ones like Instagram. That's the reason why I wanted to ask you, 
if Google Maps tracks my location and cross it with the information of "Bag Pack" 
shops in the map and my Bank Cards to identify if I was looking for this 
item but didn't buy it, or if I was looking and I did buy it... 
And if this information is also available for other companies to use 
it and to push me ads that they know they would interest me, 
specially the companies that are not part of Google.

I'd really appreciate an answer and if you are not the right point of contact, would you please help me out with the right email/contact for it?

Thank you so much,
Best regards
Cesar
