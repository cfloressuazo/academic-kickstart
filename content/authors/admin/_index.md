I'm an Engineer with 7 years of experience in the private sectoras manager, tech lead and data engineer. My interests include merging creativity, technology and strategic thinking altogether to build digital products involving Natural Language Processing, Artificial Intelligence, Big Data & Analytics.

I'm currently **Managing an Engineering Team** and leading the technical design, development and implementation of an **Enterprise Data Platform** for a Strategy and Analytics Consultancy company in Amsterdam, The Netherlands.

I've worked as a **Leading Data Scientist** in an innovative start-up building the NLP engine of the product, resulting in sales AI assistants for businesses to engage their leads through personalized emails and SMS texts.

I've also worked as a **Data Engineer**, building an operational data warehousing product to track the efficiency of communication between internal transactional IT systems.
