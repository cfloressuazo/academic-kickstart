I'm an Engineer with 7 years of experience in the private sector as a manager, tech lead and data engineer. My interests include merging creativity, technology and strategic thinking altogether to build digital products involving Natural Language Processing, Artificial Intelligence, Big Data & Analytics.

I'm currently working at [Marley Spoon](https://marleyspoon.de/) as a Senior Data Engineer based in Berlin, bringing delightful, market-fresh and easy cooking back to the people and contributing with my grain of sand to the environment by building a sustainable supply chain for a waste free world.
