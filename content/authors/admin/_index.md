I’ve had 7 years of experience working in Artificial Intelligence, Data Science and Engineering and I enjoy merging these fields with creativity and strategic thinking.

I'm currently managing an Engineering Team and leading the technical design, development and implementation for an **Enterprise Data Platform** which support end-to-end Data Products and Machine learning workflows in production for a Strategy and Analytics Consultancy company in Amsterdam, The Netherlands.

I've worked as a **Leading Data Scientist** in an innovative start-up: Intelligens Ltda. (now part of Conversica), building the NLP engine of the product, resulting in sales AI assistants for businesses to engage their leads through personalized emails and SMS texts.

I've also worked as a **Data Engineer**, building an operational data warehousing product to track the efficiency of communication between internal transactional IT systems. Other roles include the assessment of Cloud Computing services, building an ML solution for predictive maintenance and Internship in a communication company.

During my free time, I enjoy learning about new things in life, reading books, philosophy, economics, playing with my kid, hiking with my dog, snowboarding with friends, surfing and lately biking around.
